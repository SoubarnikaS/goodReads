When Rosemary Woodhouse and her husband move into an old New York City apartment building with a creepy reputation and only elderly residents, they can‚Äôt imagine what their new life will be like. Despite hearing weird noises and thinking they‚Äôre too strange for her taste, Rosemary welcomes neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet when they come to visit. Rosemary has heard strange stories about the Castavets; when she becomes pregnant and her husband lands a big acting role, the neighbors take a special interest in her wellbeing. As Rosemary becomes increasingly sick and lonely, she begins to think that her neighbors aren‚Äôt what they seem to be. First published in 1967, the countless editions and adaptations of Rosemary‚Äôs Baby show the enduring power of a great, creepy mystery.

It follows Daniel, the son of an antiquarian book dealer, who discovers a mysterious book by Julian Carax. Obsessed with the author and the book, Daniel tries to track down all his other books, but instead discovers a secret that sends him on a wild journey through the streets of post-war Barcelona. At once a murder story, an adventure narrative, and a love story, The Shadow of the Wind remains a superb read from a great talent lost too soon.

But he does not encounter what he anticipated in his journey into the metaphorical ‚Äî and very literal ‚Äî heart of darkness in the middle of the jungle.

                                                    <p>Melville wrote of his masterpiece one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.

                                                        This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.

                                                    <p>Spirited Effie Gillies has always lived on the little Scottish island of St Kilda. When the island is visited by Lord Sholto, heir of the Earl of Dumfries, sparks fly between him and Effie. She shows the handsome stranger her island for a week, and then a storm hits and shatters her world. Three months later, and the islanders are being evacuated. Effie is offered a position on the Earl's estate, and now the differences between them seem impossible, especially when a terrible secret is uncovered back on the island. Based on the true story of St Kilda, this novel takes the reader back to both island life and high society in the 1930s.

Rethinking the traditional structures of top-down hierarchies, some of Silicon Valley‚Äôs most successful companies have embraced the geek way of thinking, making decisions using trial and error, evidence and stress-testing, and doing away with the practice of upper management being the sole decision makers. By examining what it is that makes businesses and teams that embrace the approach work, Andrew McAfee has unlocked the secrets of The Geek Way, and how you can apply the principles to improve your business. The future is geeky!
